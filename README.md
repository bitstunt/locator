# Locator

- Locator is a web-based application that provides text-based directions from a given source to destination. The app is built using React.js and A\* and Dijkstra algorithms, which allow it to calculate the shortest path between two points and provide a step-by-step route.

- Our motto is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for planning and navigating routes from a given source to destination, especially for those who prefer a text-based guide over a map.

## Getting Started

To get started with Locator, simply visit the deployed website at [https://loc-ator.netlify.app/](loc-ator.netlify.app)

## Installation

To install and run the Locator app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/locator-app.git`
Install dependencies: `npm install`
Run the application: `npm start`

## Usage

To use the Locator app, follow these steps:

- Enter the starting point and destination in the input fields.
- Click on the "Find Route" button to calculate the shortest path.
- The app will display the step-by-step directions on the right-hand side of the screen.

## Technologies Used

The Locator app is built using the following technologies:

**React.js:** Used for front-end development, providing an interactive and responsive user interface.
**A\* and Dijkstra algorithms:** Used for calculating the shortest path between two points on a map.
**Netlify:** Used for deploying the application.


## Future Implementations
The following features are planned for future implementations:

 - Implementing Leaflet and React-Leaflet to display the map and the route between two points.
 - Adding support for multiple destinations and alternative routes.
 - Integrating with a real-time traffic API to provide up-to-date traffic information.
 - Providing voice-based navigation instructions.
